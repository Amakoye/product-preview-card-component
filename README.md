## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this exercise, I have been able to put in practice some of the things I've learnt about CSS. This include first putting the structure of the page in place before doing anything else, for instance, Global border-box fix and the Lobotomized owl global margins. I used the double container pattern common for centering content on a page. Finally I used the content property to set the image while on small screen device.
